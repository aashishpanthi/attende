# Project introduction

This project is about taking the whole attendance system online whithout the need of pen and paper. Just a mobile phone with our app installed on it and a decent internet connection can do the job well.

# Start with the project

Here is a short guide if you want to use this code and modify it.

## Clone the GitHub repo

Go to the folder where you want to write code (build project) and open terminal/cmd there. Paste this command `git clone https://github.com/aashishpanthi/attende.git`. Make sure git is installed on your device, if not [this guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows) can help you.

## Move to the project

After you cloned the repository, go inside the folder with the command `cd attende`.

## Install dependencies

Before the preview of project or before editing anything, install project dependencies with command `yarn install`. Again make sure you have nodejs is installed on your device.

## Start the application

If you've completed all of the previous steps, now you are ready to run your application. Run `expo start` in your terminal/cmd and enjoy.
